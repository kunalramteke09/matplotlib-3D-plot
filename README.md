# matplotlib-3D-plot
A 2D plot can only show the relationships between a single pair of axes x-y; a 3D plot on the other hand allows us to explore relationships of 3 pairs of axes: x-y, x-z, and y-z. In this article, I’ll give you an easy introduction into the world of 3D data visualisation using Matplotlib. At the end of it all, you’ll be able to add 3D plotting to your Data Science tool kit!
